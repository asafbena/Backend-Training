Yes, the new schema is compatible.

the changes i made is just adding a new string field called "motherName" with default value
"default".

However, it did not work the first time I tried it.
In order for the schema compatibility to work, they must have the same class name,
when I tried it with different class name for each schame it was not compatible.
when I did gave both of them the same class name, it did work.
